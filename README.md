# Tower Defense Game
## Summary
This is an andriod application with similar gameplay to Clash Royale. This was done during a semester long project class, COM S 309 at iowa state. I worked on the backend mainly focusing on the websocket portion of the server. Due to time constraints, there were a lot of features we were not able to finish.
